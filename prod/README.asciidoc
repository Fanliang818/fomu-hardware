= Tomu FPGA - **Production** Version

This directory contains the **production** version of the Tomu FPGA. The
production version is designed for mass production. It uses advanced PCB
technologies like laser drilled and blind vias.

You get a production version if you order from
https://xobs.io/[Sean \'xobs' Cross]
https://j.mp/fomu-cs[through or after the Crowd Supply campaign].
