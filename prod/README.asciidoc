= Tomu FPGA - **Production** Versions

This directory contains the **production** versions of the Tomu FPGA. The
production versions are designed for mass production.

Production goes through https://medium.com/@chris_boucher/the-different-engineering-validation-stages-in-a-nutshell-evt-dvt-pvt-41d1b4b2bc4a[three major phases]:

* https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-hardware/tree/master/archive/evt[*EVT* (Engineering, Validation, and Testing): The alpha stage where you make sure the board works like you think it should]
* https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-hardware/tree/master/archive/dvt[*DVT* (Design, Validation, and Testing): The beta stage where you fix all your EVT bugs, stabilize features, and start working on tooling]
* https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-hardware/tree/master/archive/pvt[*PVT* (Production, Validation, and Testing): The final release stage where you produce products]

Fomu is currently at the EVT stage, with DVT expected in early March 2019.

Fomu EVT uses extremely simple PCB technologies, and can be constructed by any PCB vendor.  It's a two-layer board with 6/6 rules and large passives.  You can omit many of the decoupling capacitors and it will probably function just fine.  This simplifies assembly by quite a bit.  Additionally, the standard 8-SOIC memory chip means that just about any flash chip will work.

Fomu DVT and Fomu EVT use advanced PCB features, such as:

* Laser drilled and blind vias -- this allows industry standard footprints for
  the WCSP parts, increasing long term reliability of the solder joints.

* Hard gold plating of USB pads and touch pads. This is designed to increase
  reliability and the number of insertions and removals before failure.

You get a production version if you order from https://xobs.io/[Sean \'xobs' Cross] https://j.mp/fomu-cs[through or after the Crowd Supply campaign].
