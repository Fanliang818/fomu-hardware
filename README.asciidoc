link:tomu.im[I'm Tomu] FPGA (Fomu for short!) a tiny FPGA board which fits in
your USB port. People sometimes call me "Fomu" for short!

I have two buttons and an RBG LED.

== Telling Tomu and Tomu FPGA apart!

Professionally produced Tomu boards have the following color scheme;
 * https://j.mp/tomu-fs[Tomu **FPGA** boards are **blue**].
 * https://j.mp/tomu-cs[**Original** Tomu boards are **green**].

However, as people are encouraged to produce their own Tomu boards, please look
at the device **careful** to check what type you have. See the following table
for what to look for;

[cols="3",]
|================================================================
|             | **Original** Tomu                 | Tomu **FPGA**
| Board Color | Green                             | Blue
| LEDs        | One Green + One Red               | One Red Green Blue LED
| Components
| A single **large** black IC taking up most of the board.
| Multiple little black ICs covering the board.

| Test point pattern
| **FIXME**
| **FIXME**

|================================================================

The original Tomu has one large black IC on the board.

* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tomu-discuss/join[Discussion mailing list] - List for discussing development / new features / etc.
* https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#tomu[IRC Channel - irc://irc.freenode.net/#tomu] - IRC channel for discussing anything related to the project.

== Board Details

There are currently *two* versions of Tomu FPGA. Both boards and based
around mostly the same schematic and should be mostly compatible and
based around the Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA and have the same set of
features listed below;

* https://xxxx/[Lattice iCE40 UltraPlus 5K]
  - 5K 4 input LUTs + DSP tiles
  - 128 kilo**bytes** internal SRAM
  - 1024 kilo**bytes** (or more) flash (XIP possible)
* 1 x RGB LED
* 2 x touch buttons

=== link:./hacker[Hacker version]

* The hacker version is designed for people who are up to the challenge of building their own board.
* It has a simpler PCB which makes it cheaper to produce in a small quantities.
* *However*, it uses a non-standard footprint for the FPGA WSCP which reduces yield and long term reliability making it unsuitable for mass production.

==== PCB Specification

CAUTION: This PCB specification is currently a *work-in-progress*.

|================================================================

=== link:./prod[Production version]

* The production version is designed for mass production.
* It uses advanced PCB technologies like laser drilled and blind vias.
* You get a production version if you order from https://xobs.io/[Sean \'xobs' Cross] https://j.mp/fomu-cs[through or after the Crowd Supply campaign].
