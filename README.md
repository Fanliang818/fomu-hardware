# [Tomu, I'm (FPGA version)](tomu.im)

[I'm Tomu](tomu.im) FPGA (Fomu for short!) a tiny FPGA which fits in your USB port.

I have two buttons and an RBG LED.

## Details

There are currently two versions of Tomu FPGA. Both boards and based around
mostly the same schematic and should be mostly compatible and based around the
Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA and have the same set of features listed below;

 * Lattice iCE40UP5K
  * 5K 4 input LUTs + DSP tiles
  * 128 kilo**bytes** internal SRAM
  * 1024 kilo**bytes** flash (XIP possible)

 * 1 x RGB LED
 * 2 x touch buttons

### [Hacker version](./hacker)

 * The hacker version is designed for people who are up to the challenge of
   building their own board.

 * It has a simpler PCB which makes it cheaper to produce in a small
   quantities.

 * **However**, it uses a non-standard footprint for the FPGA WSCP which
   reduces yield and long term reliability making it unsuitable for mass
   production.

#### PCB Specification

This PCB specification is currently a **work-in-progress**.

### [Production version](./prod)

 * The production version is designed for mass production.

 * It uses advanced PCB technologies like laser drilled and blind vias.

 * You get a production version if you order from
   [Sean 'xobs' Cross](https://xobs.io/)
   [through or after the Crowd Supply campaign](https://j.mp/fomu-cs).
