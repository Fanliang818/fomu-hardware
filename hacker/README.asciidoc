= Tomu FPGA - **Hacker** Version

CAUTION: This design is currently a *work-in-progress* and undergoing major revisions.

This directory contains the **hacker** version of the Tomu FPGA. The hacker
version is designed for people who are up to the challenge of building their
own board.

It has a simpler PCB which makes it cheaper to produce in a small quantities.

*However*, it uses a non-standard footprint for the FPGA WSCP which reduces
yield and long term reliability making it **unsuitable** for mass production.
Additionally, it has fewer power regulation components, which may impact stability.

for both the Pi 2 and Pi 3.

=== Programming with probes (the poor man's version)

Building a jig is hard if you do not have maker tools readily
available. But there is another way to make a poor man's programmer
for fomu. Not rock solid, but it works.

You have to make seven cables like this, with a DuPont female and and
a probe on the other end. Basically, you behead one end of a DuPont
cable, strip a little bit of the cable and solder a probe. My
soldering is terrible, but you do not need fine art here.

Then you connect the cables to the Raspberry and try to fit the probes
on the fomu. The space is not much, but it is possible. I suggest to
start from R and going clockwise. Leave G and V as the last ones. G
tends to snap away quite easily, but it is also available on the other
side, on the button pad. I is rather difficult too, because the board
is really crowded there, but (with my probes, at least) it is possible
to touch it just enough to have the contact done.

The pinout is the one above, that has to be matched with the Raspberry
pinout in https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-flash[fomu-flash].

V should be connected to 3.3V, not 5V. Once everything is connected,
you can run `fomu-flash`. Be sure to verify the bitstream with `-v`,
because of course the connection is quite brittle.
