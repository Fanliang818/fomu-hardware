= Tomu FPGA - **Hacker** Version

This directory contains the **hacker** version of the Tomu FPGA. The hacker
version is designed for people who are up to the challenge of building their
own board.

It has a simpler PCB which makes it cheaper to produce in a small quantities.

*However*, it uses a non-standard footprint for the FPGA WSCP which reduces
yield and long term reliability making it **unsuitable** for mass production.

== PCB Specification

CAUTION: This PCB specification is currently a *work-in-progress*.
